\Psalm{8}

\superscription{To the leader: according to The Gittith. A Psalm of David.}

\linein
\Ver{1}   O \LORD, our Sovereign,\\
    how majestic is your name in all the earth!\\!
\lineout

\linein[0001]
 You have set your glory above the heavens.\\
\Ver{2}\vin Out of the mouths of babes and infants\\
  you have founded a bulwark because of your foes,\\
    to silence the enemy and the avenger.\\!
\lineout

\linein
\Ver{3} When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,\\
    the moon and the stars that you have established;\\
\Ver{4}   what are human beings that you are mindful of them,\\
    mortals that you care for them?\\!
\lineout

\linein
\Ver{5} Yet you have made them a little lower than God,\\
    and crowned them with glory and honor.\\
\Ver{6}   You have given them dominion over the works of your hands;\\
    you have put all things under their feet,\\
\Ver{7}   all sheep and oxen,\\
    and also the beasts of the field,\\
\Ver{8}   the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea,\\
    whatever passes along the paths of the seas.\\!
\lineout

\linein
\Ver{9} O \LORD, our Sovereign,\\
    how majestic is your name in all the earth!\\!
\lineout
